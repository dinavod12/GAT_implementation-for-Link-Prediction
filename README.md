# GAT_implementation-for-Link-Prediction
A Graph Attention Network (GAT) is a neural network architecture that operates on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations .Here I implement Link Prediction on Protein dataset using message passing layers.
